# IC-IBD
Public Facing Repository of the Identification of Cohorts with IBD Study (IC-IBD). An open source study focused on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology to the field Gastroenterology, Specifically Inflammatory Bowel Disease

## Author: Dr Matt Stammers - Consultant Gastroenterologist, University Hospital Southampton

## Project Description

This study is committed to generating open-source reproducible methodology to build a firm foundation for the establishment of language-based models applied to Gastroenterology.

## Project Elements

1. Systematic Review: The systematic review is already underway registered on PROSPERO at [PROSPERO SR Record](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=388310)
2. Scalable Cohort Identification System: In order to truly scale clinical research data sciences cohort identification methodology needs to evolve. This study describes two methodologies to achieve that end - one rule-based and one machine-learning based which should scale to the identification of many disease cohorts.
3. Classification at the Point of Referral: Access to high-quality curated labelled datasets for the purposes of classification tasks is limited. Senior clinicians need to label the datasets and this costs typically a lot of money. In 2020 we put in place locally a consultant-led system of labelling all GI referrals and this part of the study seeks to examine that aspect of the dataset. 

## Anticipated Outputs

- 3 high quality publications covering the above elements.
- An open-source codebase explaining the project methodology and methods while keeping all data and secret metadata safe and not accidentally exposed.
- A cohort identification system.
- A triage classification model.
